# STS Manual Editor
This editor can be used to speed up the manual editing process.

The editor should be used in Google Chrome.

Below are steps that can help you use the tool properly.

## Contributing
If you would like to help develop the manual editor, be my guest!

I may eventually add current bugs to the 'issues' section on github.

## Usage
* Before editing, load up an existing manual or manual template by choosing a file (bottom of tools on left side), and clicking load.
* To format an entire block of text, select any of the text in that block, or put your typing cursor at any point on the line, and click on the respective button to format the block.
* Some buttons have drop-down menus under them to select a specific type of format (e.g. an unordered list vs an ordered list)
* Hitting save will download a manual. Hit save often, because sometimes the command/control + z functionality doesn't work properly in the browser. For some edits, cmd/ctrl + z will undo the edit.
* In order for the images to load properly, the manual must be moved from your downloads to the final folder.
* Hitting shift + return will allow for multiple lines under one block. This is useful for multiple line code-blocks.
